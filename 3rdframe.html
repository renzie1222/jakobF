<br>
Honda is unique in its way of adapting techniques and materials that was originally intended for racing. Spoon maintains that distinctive “Honda engine feel” with further improvement in engine performance. Spoon’s mission has been to seek “the best and most ideal” tuning balance without sacrificing engine reliability. Spoon’s engine tuning method involves careful tweaking of various elements such as the combustion chamber, weight balance of moving parts, metal contacts, piston ring tension, and valve spring rates.

<br>
Braking is the key to sport driving. Confident braking without hesitation is crucial in sport driving. When you have mastered the essence of braking to reduce speed, not to stop the car, and braking to control load balance on corner entry, you will then reach a higher level of sport driving. To make this possible, Spoon has developed premium braking systems such as the aluminum monocoque calipers. Every caliper is designed to fully adapt to Honda’s own ABS and proportion- ing valves.

<br>
In developing intake and exhaust systems, Spoon applied the principal of pulsation. Spoon recommends changing the air cleaner on the standard intake system to retain mid-range torque, and not to seek only the maximum output. Spoon concentrates on a few select Honda models to develop products based on actual circuit and winding road test. These tests are crucial for measuring differences caused by pipe length, diameter and layout for each model.

Spoon takes the utmost care in drivetrain tuning. Attention to this part is essential since the drivetrain receives an extended period of time under harsh conditions. Improper adjustment of the LSD’s torque rate can cause unpleasant sound and vibration at low speeds for everyday driving. This could ruin the whole impression of the car and its driving experience. Spoon’s extensive knowledge makes it possible to cope with these situations with careful and complete drivetrain work.

<font face="verdana" size="5" color=""><b>SUSPENSION SYSTEM</b></font>
<br>
Imagine driving on a smooth and flat road surface. The wheels are rotating at high speed, and the suspension arms are moving up and down, sometimes calmly and at other times quickly. When the driver brakes hard, the suspension arms move intensely to compensate for the road surface and the dampers begin to attenuate. In such varying conditions, the suspension must deliver an even body position, allowing the vehicle to run straight and maximize tire grip. Spoon aims to retain optimal dampening with minimal friction. This is key to improving driving feel and achieving higher performance.
<br>
<br>
<font face="verdana" size="5" color=""><b>BODY REINFORCEMENT</b></font>
<br>
Spoon seeks to produce a tough and rigid body. Rigidity is absolutely necessary in order to quickly communicate driver input to the steering and suspension. Additonally, a rigid body immediately feeds road conditions and traction back to the driver. Spoon provides various body reinforcement parts produced with experience from building race cars from stock cars.

<br>
Spoon has consistently been the benchmark for functional Honda aerodynamic aftermarket parts and received support from Honda fans throughout the world. In 1987 Spoon became the first in the world to manufacture and distribute carbon fiber hoods. In the pursuit of true Honda spirit, Spoon has developed aero kits with sporty and energetic styling. Aerodynamic components increase track performance and driver confidence. Spoon’s simple and functional design supports the pleasure of driving. “Love for Honda”, that is the universal identity and value of Spoon.

<font face="verdana" size="5" color=""><b>ACCESSORIES</b></font>
<br>
Knowledge gained during racing is directly reflected back to product development. Accesso- ries not only provide a cosmetic upgrade but serve to improve performance and durability in all applications. Use of high quality materials ensures standards down to the smallest details.
